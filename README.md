# Evolving-Robot
![render](mass_based_best_pink.gif)

The work aims to *evolve*  an arbitrarily-shaped robot and the distribution of the materials on the
robot. To employ evolutionary algorithms, a physics simulator is built to intergrate with the algorithms.

## Evolutionary Computation
### Representation

### Variation Operators - Crossover

### Variation Operators - Mutation
